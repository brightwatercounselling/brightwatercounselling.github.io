  <font size=6>How I Work</font><P>
  
  <font size=4>“To know thyself is the beginning of wisdom”   -   Socrates <br> <P>

We are all human beings and part of being human is to experience struggles in life.<br>
 Sometimes these struggles become overwhelming, this is where counselling <br>
  carried out within a safe, non-judgemental and empathic environment, can make a lasting,<br>
   profound and positive difference to a person’s life. <P>

Quite often our thoughts and emotions are considered to be separate from our bodies,<br>
 when in reality they are inseparable. For example, if a powerful emotion is ignored or suppressed<br>
  for a length of time it can literally “make itself felt” in the body. <P>

My approach to therapy comes from a holistic perspective, I take into consideration a person<br>
 as a whole-being; thoughts, physical feelings and emotions, giving all three equal attention.<br>
  I focus on raising self-awareness which leads to greater self-knowledge<br>
   and a deeper understanding of ourselves as human beings. <P>

This process can be challenging at times and requires commitment from both therapist<br>
 and client and I endeavour to create a strong, supportive working relationship<br>
  within the therapeutic framework where a person can safely explore their inner-self and personal difficulties. <P>
