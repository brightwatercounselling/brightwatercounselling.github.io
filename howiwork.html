  <font size=6>How I Work</font><P>
	
My approach to therapy comes from a holistic perspective, I take into consideration a person<br>
 as a whole-being; thoughts, physical feelings and emotions, giving all three equal attention.<br>
  I focus on raising self-awareness which leads to greater self-knowledge<br>
   and a deeper understanding of ourselves as human beings. <P>
  
Part of being human is to experience struggles in life.<br>
 Sometimes these struggles become overwhelming, this is where counselling <br>
  carried out within a safe, non-judgemental and empathic environment, can make a lasting,<br>
   profound and positive difference to a person’s life. <P>

Quite often our thoughts and emotions are considered to be separate from our bodies,<br>
 when in reality they are inseparable. For example, if a powerful emotion is ignored or suppressed<br>
  for a length of time it can literally “make itself felt” in the body. <P>

 I endeavour to create a strong, supportive working relationship<br>
 within the therapeutic framework where a person can safely explore their inner-self and personal difficulties. <P>

 <font size=4>Testimonial -	</font><P>
 <font size=3>"I felt immediately comforted by Poppi's energy and felt like I could trust her straight away<br>
 when talking about very difficult topics. Her holistic approach was completely new to me and, <br>
whilst it helped me to process my main problems, I genuinely believe I will be using these skills<br>
and ways of thinking for the rest of my life for (probably) all aspects of my life. <P>

Poppi has changed my life and I feel incredibly lucky that our paths met<br>
and only wish that others can find her as I did. Thank you for everything Poppi." RR.<P>
